# \<nodecg-replicant-input\> [![Published on webcomponents.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/webcomponents.org-published-blue.svg)](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/NodeCGElemements/nodecg-replicant-input) ![Polymer 2 only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Polymer%202-only-blue.svg)

A &lt;paper-input> element that has two-way binding with a Replicant, for use in Polymer 2. Works with NodeCG v0.9.x.

## Motivation
This element allows you to easily make a Replicant directly editable in your UI, rather than needing to manually connect a Replicant to an input element yourself.

## Installation

From your bundle's root directory:
```sh
bower install --save NodeCGElements/nodecg-replicant-input
```

## Usage
```html
<nodecg-replicant-input replicant-name="my-replicant"></nodecg-replicant-input>
```
